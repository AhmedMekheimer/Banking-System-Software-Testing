# Banking-System-Software-Testing
I did the GUI Testing, unfortunately I was trying to use Squish & TestFx and actually worked to test some parts of the GUI in the application, but didn't have time to understand them more as I couldn't test the majority of the application's GUI and the course didn't teach us how to use such tools, So it lead for me to submit a full tested GUI application and take good marks to do "Manual Testing" Implementation.

The Project's Focus is Software Testing, We(team) didn't implement the Banking Java Application but rather applied Testing on it
