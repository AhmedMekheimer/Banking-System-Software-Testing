# Banking-System-Software-Testing
I did the GUI Testing, unfortunately I was trying to use Squish and other Automated Testing Tools but didn't have time to understand them and apply them on the Banking Application as the course didn't teach us how to use such tools.

The Project's Focus is Software Testing, We(team) didn't implement the Banking Java Application but rather applied Testing on it
